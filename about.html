            <img src="images/person-assistive-tech.jpg" alt="Professional photo of a person sitting at a modern desk using a computer with a screen reader and refreshable braille display, smiling confidently in a well-lit workspace" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
            
            <div class="intro-text">
                <p>Hi, I'm Desmond. But my friends call me Des.</p>
                
                <p>I'm of the firm belief that digital independence is a fundamental human right. We live so much of our lives online now that being able to navigate that space on your own terms isn't just a convenience—it's a necessity. My favorite thing to do is help my friends unlock that independence for themselves.</p>
                
                <p>The tools you need to succeed are already out there. Sometimes, you just need a hand finding the ones that fit your life. I love helping people explore those options and sticking with them until they're ready to conquer the digital domain solo.</p>
                
                <h2>The things I know best</h2>
                
                <p>I've spent years diving deep into the tech that makes the web accessible. If you're curious about any of these, I'm your guy:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Screen Readers:</strong> Getting the most out of JAWS, NVDA, or VoiceOver.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Braille:</strong> Making refreshable braille displays feel like second nature.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Magnification:</strong> Tweaking settings for low-vision users so everything is clear.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Voice Control:</strong> Navigating and typing using only your voice.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Learning the shortcuts to move lightning-fast and leave your mouse-using friends in the dust.</p>
                
                <h2>Why this matters to me</h2>
                
                <p>The internet meant everything to me when I was a teenager. It was the place where I actually met my friends, formed real bonds, discovered my favorite music, and—naturally—watched way too many viral videos (yes, including Llamas with Hats).</p>
                
                <p>But more than just entertainment, the internet was my classroom. It was where I went to learn... well, everything. It wasn't all "good" stuff, but it was my source of information.</p>
                
                <p>Today, I'm dedicated to making sure everyone can tap into that same resource. Information is out there, and regardless of how you interact with your technology, I want to show you how to get to it. Whether it's the absolute basics of using a computer or learning to fly through websites with a screen reader, I just want to help you claim your independence.</p>
