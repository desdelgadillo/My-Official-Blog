Welcome to your first automated post! Writing in Markdown is much faster than HTML because you can focus on the words rather than the tags. Yes.

## Why use Markdown?
Markdown is a "plain text" language that is very easy for screen readers to navigate. Here are a few things you can do easily:

* **Bold text**: Use two asterisks around a word.
* **Lists**: Just use an asterisk and a space at the start of a line.
* **Links**: Put the link text in [brackets] and the URL in (parentheses).

## What happens next?
When you save this file in the `drafts/` folder:
1. The GitHub Action wakes up.
2. It converts this text into an HTML file in your `posts/` folder.
3. It updates your `blog.json` file automatically.
