                <p>When I started my iPhone journey in 2011, I didn't feel alone. That's because there was a centralized community of blind Apple users called AppleVis, where hundreds of user-created tutorials were available. That website is still around, currently enjoying backing from BeMyEyes.</p>

                <p>But for Android users, the learning process feels a lot less lonely.</p>

                <p>But it doesn't have to.</p>

                <p>Assembled with love and over much coffee, here are some of the resources I personally used to learn TalkBack and the Android ecosystem as a whole. Have fun, be careful, and let me know which of these is your favorite.</p>
                
                <h2>Carrie on Accessibility</h2>
<p>A devout Android user herself, content extraordinaire Carrie on Accessibility is always on the hunt for ways to make Android more accessible. Whether it's Talkback you're trying to learn or zoom and magnification tweaks, you'll find great information here.</p>p>
                <p>Carrie's YouTube channel is a treasure trove of interviews with Android app developers, as well as  demos and hacks for Talkback and different Android sorcery.</p>

                <h2>Blind Android Users</h2>
                <p>This weekly podcast has been running for years, and over that time several Android releases have come and gone. This team has covered, demoed, and taught it all.</p>
                <p>Your best bet is to start with the most recent content on their channel and work your way backwards as to not get overwhelemed by the shere enormity of what's available here.</p>
